# Pokemon Stats Checker ~for Engineers~

## Description
This App is a vscode extension.<br/>
It has a lot of features. 
- collect your coding metrics.
- calculate pokemon base stats by your coding feature (in our original algorithm)
- find a pokemon that has similar feature with your stats by using open pokemon data.
- generate an awesome radar chart from your coding feature.
- share it with your friends by putting a graph photo on your github profile.

## As a Side Note
- we just support 1st generation pokemon. (id 1 ~ 151)
- we can just store your previous metrics data and 1 graph image because of our financial problem.
