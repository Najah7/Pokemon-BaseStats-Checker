# Pokemon Stats Checker ~for Engineers~

## Description
This App is a vscode extension.<br/>
It has a lot of features. 
- collect your coding metrics.
- calculate pokemon base stats by your coding feature (in our original algorithm)
- find a pokemon that has similar feature with your stats by using open pokemon data.
- generate an awesome radar chart from your coding feature.
- share it with your friends by putting a graph photo on your github profile.

## As a Side Note
- we just support 1st generation pokemon. (id 1 ~ 151)
- we can just store your previous metrics data and 1 graph image because of our financial problem.

## How to install
We are writing about this soon.

## How to use
![usage.mp4](usage.mp4)
I will monitor your coding activities within VSCode and evaluate them quantitatively using six metrics (hp, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, speed). The goal is to objectively assess your coding skills and potentially assist in grading coding assessments for companies. Additionally, user input logs will be saved in CSV format, paving the way for future possibilities of quantitative and automated coding evaluations through machine learning. However, current functionality is limited to confirming your coding characteristics, akin to discovering a perfect partner when compared to Pokémon base stats. So, let's proceed to solve the coding challenges and explore your coding traits in comparison to Pokémon base stats.
